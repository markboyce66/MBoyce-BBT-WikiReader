To run the api, just open index.html.

As I had stated during the interview, my experience with javascript is not at the level where I would comfortably say I could write JS code from scratch, so I did some research and found a few completed samples of this project and downloaded them to use as a reference/resource. I proceeded to go through the completed sample (attached in original-project folder) and using the following resources I deconstructed how the code was working  and added numerous code comments and proceeded to modify/customize the project to accomplish this task.

Here is the links to some of the resources I used to complete this task in case you want to verify my research sources:

When submitting your finished application please answer the following questions:
1.	Why did you choose the particular solution?
While researching the instructions, I found this was possibly/originally a freecodecamp challenge and after finding a few sample completed projects, I was able to modify and add new functionality to the base project I chose the included a search field.
2.	What were some of the challenges you faced?
With some knowledge of Javascript, my concern was how to write this from scratch. Also, with little previous experience with JSON or Wikipedia API, the challenge was to research the components/code involved to understand what functions/variables/etc... we're being used and using the WIKI API sandbox (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ApiSandbox#action=help) and the settings understand how to manipulate the query so I could successfully modify and add to the base functionality of the API. 

3.	What could have you done better?
The one area I feel I could have completed better is the CSS for responsive/mobile. Within the time constraints, I think I could come up with a better solution instead of the @media query and doubling the font size to get it to show/read better on mobile devices.
